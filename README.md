# Machine Learning Models: Plant Disease Detection and Weather Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains two machine learning models developed during a workshop at VCET on machine learning:

1. **Plant Disease Detection**: A model to predict plant diseases based on image data or specific plant characteristics.
2. **Weather Prediction**: A model that predicts weather conditions based on meteorological data inputs.

These models were implemented using Python libraries like **scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **Numpy**, and visualization tools like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## Plant Disease Detection

### Description
The **Plant Disease Detection** model is designed to classify different types of plant diseases using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to assist in the early detection of plant diseases, allowing for timely intervention and treatment.


  
### Tools and Libraries Used:
- **scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **Numpy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

### Model Summary
The model processes plant data (either images or feature inputs) and applies classification algorithms to predict the presence of diseases.

## Weather Prediction

### Description
The **Weather Prediction** model forecasts weather conditions based on meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. This model can be helpful for predicting local weather patterns and providing actionable insights for agriculture, event planning, and safety protocols.



### Tools and Libraries Used:
- **scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **Numpy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

### Model Summary
The model leverages regression and classification algorithms to predict weather patterns based on historical data inputs.
